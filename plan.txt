pieces (pawn) not removed correctly (by loading?)
-> resimulate with new save
-> check if pawn positions make sense (did not in 1st save)

if queen takes pawn in game "o": king must take (make function filter check now)
-> qc2 invalid move




game saving: new move updating on board, but not in piecesPos
checkforcheck: 


in function: 
if king currenty in check:
-> must move or block or take piece
if king in next move in check:
-> cannot make move that unblocks king
